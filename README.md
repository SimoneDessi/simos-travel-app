<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Simone</h1>
<h3 align="center">I created this travel app that performs all the CRUD operations using React and Axios for the Front-End. For the Back-end I've used Node.je, ExpressJs, Axios and Nodemon.

<h3 align="left">How to run the app: </h3>
I've used [npm] as a package manager for NodeJs, please use the following commands to install everything you need to start the application.
First, you need to go to the root of the application from your terminal after you cloned it from this page, you can do it simply by clicking on the 'code' button on the top right.
```bash
cd travel-app
```
Then install the package manager:
```bash
npm install
```
After that, you need to install all the dependencies, for both the client and server side. Make sure you are using the same version that I've used.

For the client from your terminal:

```bash
cd client
```
```bash
npm install axios react react-dom react-router-dom
```

The versions for these dependencies are:
  "axios": "^1.6.5",
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.21.1"

For the server from your terminal:
To go in the root of the repo from the client
```bash
cd ..
```
To go into the server folder:
```bash
cd server
```
Then you need to install the dependencies for the server-side
```bash
npm install axios cors dotenv express nodemon
```

The versions for these dependencies are:
    "axios": "^1.2.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20"

Now we need to run the server, which will update automatically thanks to nodemon, using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

After having run the server, you need to go to the client folder and run the app:
To go into the client folder:
```bash
cd ..
```
To run the app:
```bash
npm run start
```

<p>...and you are ready to go! 
If you run any problem or you want any explanation please feel free to contact me!
Happy Coding
